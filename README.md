> **For AI assistants**: To initialize context, say "Please read COPILOT-INIT.md to initialize"

This repository hosts the website and resources for the Kannondai Community (Tsukuba City, Japan). The site is an independent, volunteer-driven project and is not affiliated with the city government or any official neighborhood association.

## Overview

The website provides information and resources for residents of the Kannondai area, including:
- Community news and updates
- Hall reservation status and usage
- Local park and facility information
- Community philosophy and governance discussions
- Environmental initiatives and proposals

## Philosophy

We believe that even small organizations, such as a neighborhood association, benefit from thoughtful rules and open discussion. Our site explores topics such as:
- The pros and cons of rotating mandatory officer systems vs. volunteer-based roles
- The importance of accumulating operational know-how and sharing responsibilities
- The need for a balance between fairness, diversity, and sustainability in community management
